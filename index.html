<h1 style="color:red">The start of my new Website using the h1 tag</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph using the p tag 
    Below is a link to a sacred website!!! and just above that link is the use of 
    a (hr) tag which creates a horizontal line to seperate content.
</p>
<hr></hr>

<a  style="color:blueviolet"  href=https://google.com>
    this is the link I was talking about
</a>
<p>the (pre) tag helps to format preformatted text, solving what they would
    call the poem problem. For instance, this poem below is not using a bagillion page breaks, 
    it is just using the pre tag becuase it is pre formatted from antoher site. 

    <pre style="text-align:center;">
        Do not go gentle into that good night,
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
        Because their words had forked no lightning they
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        
        Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
        Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
        And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        
        Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        
        And you, my father, there on the sad height,
        Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
        Do not go gentle into that good night.
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</pre>
